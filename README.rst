Use *knobs* if you worship at the church of the `12 Factor App <http://www.12factor.net/>`_

*knobs* will search for a nominated environmental file (default *.env*) and load that
into the environment. A knob is type aware, configured from the environment and its value can be
persisted to ease the creation of configuration files.
