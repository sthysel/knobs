Use ``knobs`` if you worship at the church of the `12 Factor App <http://www.12factor.net/>`_

A knob is a wrapper for an environment variable. It can:

* Read and write an environment variable
* Make sure it is of the expected type
* Validate a value is good.


``knobs`` will search for a nominated environmental file (default ``.env``) and load that
into the environment. A knob is type aware, configured from the environment and its value can be
persisted to ease the creation of configuration files.
